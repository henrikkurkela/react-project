# News Platform Site

A simple news site for a press company. Developed for Helsinki University course Full Stack Web Development Project.

To start the application, type:
```
npm run dev
```

The backend requires a MySQL server to function. Table creation queries can be found in the [server readme](/server/models/README.md) file. Database details should be added to the [example.env](example.env) file, which should then be renamed to .env
